----------------Semi-Supervised Learning Method for Detecting DDoS Attacks--------------------
Even though sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) techniques have revolutionized DDoS assault detection
methods in recent years, the attack is still regarded as one of the most significant danger categories on the Internet.
The vast majority of current methods for detecting Distributed Denial of Service can be divided into two categories:
supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Labeled samples of network traffic datasets are selected for learning
via supervised machine learning categories for DDOS detection. Unsupervised machine learning techniques, on the
other hand, examine incoming traffic for anomalous patterns without requiring any training labels. The two remaining
methods must deal with substantial amounts of false alarms, misclassifications, and network traffic data. In this paper, we
describe a semi-supervised machine learning approach to DDOS detection using online sequential techniques, Network
Entropy estimate, Co-clustering, Information Gain Ratio, and the Extra-Trees algorithm. Additionally, the method
includes an unsupervised component that lowers the quantity of common traffic data required for DDoS detection,
enhancing accuracy and lowering false positive rates. Additionally, the supervised component makes it possible to
efficiently classify DDoS activity in addition to lowering the false positive rates of identified traffic.
